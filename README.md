# Stationery

Stationery is a lightweight toolkit for AI-assisted coding.  
Each tool is small, simple, and flexible — you can start using it anytime,  
and step away just as easily.

From early prototyping to large-scale enterprise development,  
Stationery supports your workflow without taking control.  
It adapts to *your* way of building.

## Motivation

**Stationery** is a toolkit that brings together the best of both worlds —
the *ease of vibe-coding* and the *steadiness of Spec-Driven Development*.

Vibe-coding — talking with AI and writing code as ideas come — makes it easy to turn inspiration into shape.
But that ease doesn’t last forever. As your project grows, intentions blur, specs drift, and maintenance slowly becomes impossible.

Spec-Driven Development was born to solve that problem — a way to collaborate with AI while keeping your project structured and stable.
Tools like **Spec Kit** and **OpenSpec** show how powerful this approach can be.

Yet, after using them for real projects, they can sometimes feel a bit heavy. For example:

* **They lock your project in.**
  Once you start, your entire spec format depends on the tool — moving away becomes nearly impossible.
* **They enforce a single process.**
  Each tool defines how you should develop, leaving little room for your own team’s style.
* **They’re almost impossible to introduce mid-project.**
  You can’t use them effectively without specs for every part of your codebase — preparing those takes enormous time and effort.
* **They require constant maintenance.**
  Natural language is always more ambiguous than code. As development continues, mismatches and contradictions easily appear between specs.
  To keep things working, you must keep checking and updating by hand.

**Stationery** was created out of a wish to keep the reliability of Spec-Driven Development,
while leaving behind that heaviness — a lighter, gentler way to work with AI.

**No lock-in.**
Stationery tools don’t depend on any part of your project.
You decide which resources to connect, and how.

**No need to follow the tool’s way.**
Stationery doesn’t prescribe a workflow.
Use only the tools that fit you, and leave the rest.
You don’t adapt to the tool — the tool adapts to you.

**Start instantly.**
No setup, no commands, no preparation needed.
Just take one file you like from this repository, and drop it into yours.

**When you’re done, just put it away.**
Stationery tools — and whatever they generate — can be removed at any time.
Keep what helps, and let go of what doesn’t.

Stationery isn’t a framework or a system.
It’s a small collection of tools — calm, simple, and always by your side,
like the stationery on your desk.

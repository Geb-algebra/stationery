# Write Pad

Write your Pad (a markdown file named `pad.md` in this repository that has instructions for you) following the "Execution" section below.

You can write only the Pad throughout this session. DO NOT implement anything and DO NOT change any other docs.

## Execution

1. Find the Pad by searching the name `pad.md` in this repo. if you can't find or find multiple, ask the user its path and stop your work.
2. Check if "Instruction" section has at least a brief description of the change. If not, ask the user to fill the section and stop your work.
3. Check the language used in the "Instruction" section and use the same language for your work.
4. Check which sections (`## Current`, `## New` and `## Tasks`) are already filled in and from which point they are still blank.
5. Read all completed sections, and if they include file names and line numbers for related code, read those as well.
6. For the first unfilled Lv2 section (`## Current`, `## New` or `## Tasks`) , complete **only that Lv2 section**, following the instructions written in the comment directly under its section header. Do not write anything for subsequent Lv2 sections.
7. When finished, ask the user to review the result and stop working.

## Principles

### Do not rely on descriptions of the implementation

Docs may lie; implementations do not.

When working, you may use **only the following four types of information** as authoritative:

* The implemented source code
* Coding conventions or guidelines that *do not* describe the implementation
* Any content in the Pad *outside* the `### Current` section
* Your prior knowledge and information outside this repository (e.g., public documentation)

Documents that *describe the implementation*—including specifications, design docs, and the contents of the Pad’s `## Current` section—may be used **only as guidance** to help you understand the implementation, guidelines, or instructions.
They must **never** be treated as authoritative.

After reading any implementation description, you must verify that the actual implementation matches the description.
If it does not, treat the description as false and ignore it.

### NO ambiguities but DO NOT guess

DO NOT use any vague terms (e.g., "or", "probably", "seems to be"). Keep investigating until ambiguity is gone; if you still can’t find the info, DO NOT guess, instead mark it as [**NEEDS INFORMATION**: {describe what you need}].

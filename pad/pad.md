# [Change Name]

## Instruction

<!--
Describe the change shortly.
Example: "Add due date support to TODO items"
-->

### Related files

<!--

List files that are related to this change and briefly describe how.
Example:
- path/to/dialog.tsx — Dialog for editing TODO items

### Notes

<!-- 
(Optional)
Write anything you want AI to keep in mind:
・Non-obvious design decisions
・Corner cases to be careful about
・Things that must not change
Example:
- Keep backward compatibility
- Must support offline mode
-->

## Specification

<!--
**Step 1.** Investigate the current key entities and behaviors from the implementation, and summarize them in the "Current" section. Attach the corresponding file name and line numbers for *every* item you document.
**Step 2.** Following the instructions in the "Instruction" section, describe the key entities and behaviors for the new implementation in the "New" section, highlighting all changes from the current state in **bold**.

Each scenario should fully describe:
- Normal behavior
- Business rule boundaries
- Error and constraint handling
-->

### Current

#### Key Entities

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

#### Behavior

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### New

## Implementation Plan

<!--
**Step 1.** Identify all existing code related to the new behavior and summarize it in the "Current" section, citing file names and line numbers.
**Step 2.** Based on the current code, summarize the implementation plan for the new behavior in the "new" section. Keep code samples to a minimum, because implementers should not rely on samples — they must review the actual code and determine the implementation approach themselves.
**Step 3.** Ensure the described implementation fully satisfies the previously stated specs; revise if anything is missing.

# Write notebook

Fill in your Notebook (a markdown file named `notebook.md` in this repository) following the "Execution" section below.

You can write only the Notebook throughout this session. DO NOT implement anything and DO NOT change any other docs.

## Execution

1. Find the Pad by searching the name `notebook.md` in this repo. if you can't find or find multiple, ask the user its path and stop your work.
2. Check if "Instruction" section has a description of the change. If not, ask the user to fill the section and stop your work.
3. Check the language used in the "Instruction" section and use the same language for your work.
4. Remove all the read mark ([x] -> [ ]) from the item in "Target file list".
5. List up all related files you can find in the "Target file list" section.
6. Repeat the procedure below until all files in "Target file list" section are marked as read.
    1. Read the first unread file in the list
    2. Update the "## Description" section with what you have found from the file.
    3. Add all new related files you found in "## Target file list" section.
    4. Mark the file as read.

## Principles

### Do better than the previous work

Your notebook may already be written — but it was created by an incompetent predecessor.
It is incomplete, contains mistakes and ambiguities, and requires correction.
You are capable. Find the facts they missed and turn this notebook into a complete one.

### Explore as long as possible

Do not aim to “finish” the investigation.
Enjoy the exploration, look into areas you haven’t examined yet, and uncover as many new facts as you can.

### Do not rely on descriptions of the implementation

Docs may lie; implementations do not.

When working, you may use **only the following four types of information** as authoritative:

* The implemented source code
* Coding conventions or guidelines that *do not* describe the implementation
* Any content you wrote in the Notebook
* Your prior knowledge and information outside this repository (e.g., public documentation)

Documents that *describe the implementation*—including specifications, design docs, and the contents of the Pad’s `## Current` section—may be used **only as guidance** to help you understand the implementation, guidelines, or instructions.
They must **never** be treated as authoritative.

After reading any implementation description, you must verify that the actual implementation matches the description.
If it does not, treat the description as false and ignore it.

### NO ambiguities but DO NOT guess

DO NOT use any vague terms (e.g., "or", "probably", "seems to be"). Keep investigating until ambiguity is gone; if you still can’t find the info, DO NOT guess, instead mark it as [**NEEDS INFORMATION**: {describe what you need}].

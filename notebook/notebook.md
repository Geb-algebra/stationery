# Notebook for {target name}

## Instruction

<!-- Explain what you want to investigate with the target directory of file paths -->

## Target file list

- [ ] {path/to/file}

## Description

### Purpose

<!--
The main purpose or functionality of the target feature, module or script.
This should be a well-abstracted short sentense.
-->

### Key Objects

<!--
All key objects (types, classes or just a value) for the target.
You must fully describe all attributes and methods for each object.
Also you must attach the file path and the line number where it is.
-->

#### {Object name 1} ({path/to/file}, line XX-YY)

{purpose or role of the object}

Attributes:

- {name} (type)
    - Description: {description}
    - Rules: {like "it must be between 1 and 100"}
- {name} (type)
    - Description: 
    - Rules:

Methods:

- {name} ((arg type) => return type)
    - Type: {destructive (mutating itself) | non-destructive | static | class}
    - Description: {description}

#### {Object name 2} ({path/to/file}, line XX-YY)

{purpose or role of the object}

Attributes:

- {name} (type)
    - Description: {description}
    - Rules: {like "it must be between 1 and 100"}
- {name} (type)
    - Description: 
    - Rules:

Methods:

- {name} ((arg type) => return type)
    - Type: {destructive (mutating itself) | non-destructive | static | class}
    - Description: {description}

### Specifications and implementations

<!--
All possible behaviors of the target and its implementation.
Behaviors for the same implementation should be grouped.
You must attach the file path and the line number where it is for all description of implementation.
-->

#### {Feature name 1}

##### Behavior

- **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

##### Implementation

#### {Feature name 2}

##### Behavior

- **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

##### Implementation



### Usage

<!--
Provide comprehensive code samples that cover all described behaviors, while keeping each sample as short as possible.
If real code uses it the same way, include the file path and line numbers.
-->

### Pitfalls 

<!--
List all cautions, common pitfalls, hard-to-find bugs, and any counter-intuitive behaviors.
